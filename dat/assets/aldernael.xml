  <description>To an ordinary visitor Aldernael might appear rough and unpleasant. When you consider that the world used to be a lifeless planet with a toxic surface and barely any atmosphere to speak of, it's really become a lot more hospitable since the Soromid began to terraform it. Currently, the planet is going thru a mainstream colonization phase. New immigrants arrive every day and Soromid habitation centers are constantly under construction.</description>
  <bar>Due to the heavy development on Aldernael the spaceport bar is subject to occasional relocation. The spaceport is at the center of this, of course, and so the bar suffers and benefits from this in turns. This growth leads to more customers but also the occasional move from one building to another to make room for renovations.</bar>
