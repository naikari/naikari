  <description>In an impressive feat of de-terraforming, the Dvaered have transformed Aleph from a class M planet to a barren wasteland. While the planet is now mostly residential with no real industrial activity to speak of, Dvaered officials have made little effort to clean up the extensive pollution caused by its once powerful, unregulated industry.</description>
  <bar>The air in the spaceport bar, and indeed everywhere on this planet, is stuffy and uncomfortable to breathe. No amount of air conditioning and filtering is going to fix the air quality completely, and even the drinks don't help much to take patrons' mind off of it.</bar>
