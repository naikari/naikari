-- MISSION: The macho teenager
-- DESCRIPTION: A man tells you that his son has taken one of his yachts without permission and
-- is joyriding it with his girlfriend to impress her. Disable the yacht and board it, then take
-- the couple back to the planet (destroying the yacht incurs a penalty)

ask_text = _([["Ah, {player}! Well met, and what perfect timing! Perhaps you can help me resolve another matter.

"You see, it's my son. He's taken a client's yacht to space without their permission, taking along his girlfriend. That boy is such a handful. I'm sure he's trying to show off his piloting skills to impress her, but like myself, he doesn't even have a pilot's license! The nerve, right? I need you to get out there, disable the yacht, and take them both back here. Can you do this for me? I'll pay you {credits} for the trouble."]])

yes_text = _([["Thank you! He doesn't know how to work the hyperdrive, so they won't have left the system. It's a Gawain named Credence.

"It should go without saying, but whatever you do, don't destroy the ship. I don't want to lose my son over this, so make sure you equip some non-lethal weapons, like ion cannons or Medusa missiles, or maybe a weapons ionizer. You should be able to find something suitable at the outfitter; I checked earlier. Use those non-lethal weapons to disable the Credence, then you can retrieve my disobedient son and his girlfriend by either #bdouble-clicking#0 it or by pressing {board_key}. You can just leave the Credence where you find it; I'll have it recovered later.

"Well then, I hope to see you again soon!"]])

The boy is furious that you attacked and disabled "his" ship, but when you mention that his mother is quite upset and wants him to come back right now, he quickly pipes down. You march the young couple onto your ship and seal the airlock behind you.]])

pay_text = _([[Terra awaits you at the spaceport. She gives her son and the young lady a stern look and curtly commands them to wait for her in the spaceport hall. The couple droops off, and Terra turns to face you with a smile.

"You've done fantastic work once again, {player}," she says. "As promised, I have deposited your payment into your account. I'm going to give my son a reprimand he'll not soon forget, so hopefully he won't repeat this little stunt anytime soon. Well then, I must be going. Thank you again, and I hope to see you again in the future!"]])
