local accept_text = _([["Thank you very much. I'll be at your ship when you're ready for me. I'll show you where we need to go once we're in space."]])

local starmap_text = _([["Alright, {player}, let me show you where we need to go. Could you open your starmap by pressing {starmapkey}, please?"]])

local jump_text = _([["As you can see, I've marked the {system} system on your starmap. That's the system we need to go to. Luckily, it seems you already know the jump point to get there, so if you just select {system} with the mouse and click the Autonav button, we should be there in no time!"]])

local target_nearest_text = _([[As you enter {system}, you see an icon indicating another ship on your radar. However, something seems off. Sirens blare as you realize that the ship is hostile!

Seeing this, Ian's face goes pale. "N-no way! This is supposed to be the safe part of Empire space! Quick, {player}! Press {target_hostile_key} so you can aim your weapons at whatever that ship is!"]])

local fight_text = _([[You see that the control you engaged automatically sets your designated target to the nearest hostile ship, which is the one you noticed on your radar. You can see what it is now: a Pirate Hyena. The sight makes Ian hyperventilate despite your best efforts to calm him down.

"P-please," Ian urges, "whatever you do, don't let that pirate kill us! Shoot them down or something!" As Ian continues to panic, you grab your ship's combat controls, telling yourself against your own instincts that this will be just like the asteroid mining you did previously.]])

local dest_text = _([[With the pirate now defeated, you see Ian visibly relax. "Th-thank you," he stutters. "Now we just need to land on {planet} andâ€¦ oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!" You look at your radar and see the source of Ian's newfound panic: a large fleet of pirates. "There's too many of them! Oh, I knew I should've never come out here! We're gonna die! I don't wanna die!"]])

local pay_text = _([[As you finish the landing procedures and arrive on the surface of {planet}, you notice an Imperial Lieutenant waiting for you. Unsure what to think, you step outside of your ship and begin to salute him, as is the custom, but are interrupted by the sound of Ian's voice behind you. "Milo! Oh, Milo, I'm so happy to s-see you."

With tears in his eyes, Ian rushes to Lieutenant Milo, who opens his arms and firmly embraces him. "It's OK, love," he gently whispers. "I'm here. You're safe."

After a few minutes, Ian calms down and hands you a credit chip. "Thank you, {player}," he says.

"And thank you from me as well," Milo adds, handing you a second credit chip. "Thank you for keeping my boyfriend safe. As a token of my gratitude, I'd be willing to personally offer you a chance to climb the ranks of the Empire. Meet me at the bar if you're interested." He grabs Ian's hand, gives him a kiss, and walks off with him.]])
