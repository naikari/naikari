  <description>This relatively bulky drone is built to crack open large ships from afar. It accomplishes this task admirably. Drones require no pilot, making them a safer approach in dangerous situations. They do, however, need some careful maintenance. All the tools needed to take care of them are provided with the bay.</description>
