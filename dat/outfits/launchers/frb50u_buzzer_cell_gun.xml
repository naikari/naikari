  <description>Guns are weapons mounted in a fixed forward position. They provide a lightweight source of firepower, perfect for agile ships. However, their ability to swivel to aim at the target is constrained. Buzzer Cell Guns fire fast, long-range, high-energy superionized projectiles which are pre-energized and stored in Buzzer Cells.</description>
