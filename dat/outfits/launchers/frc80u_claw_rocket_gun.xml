  <description>Guns are weapons mounted in a fixed forward position. They provide a lightweight source of firepower, perfect for agile ships. However, their ability to swivel to aim at the target is constrained. Claw Rocket Guns fire slow, high yield Claw class unguided rockets, which cause a kinetic explosion on contact with the target.</description>
