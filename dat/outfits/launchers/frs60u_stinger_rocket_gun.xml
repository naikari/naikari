  <description>Guns are weapons mounted in a fixed forward position. They provide a lightweight source of firepower, perfect for agile ships. However, their ability to swivel to aim at the target is constrained. Stinger Rocket Guns fire fast, low yield yield Stinger class unguided rockets, which cause a kinetic explosion on contact with the target.</description>
