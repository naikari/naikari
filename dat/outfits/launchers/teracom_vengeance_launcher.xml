  <description>TeraCom's patented Vengeance launcher hardware considerably reduces the time it takes to achieve a lock. Sometimes, those few seconds can make all the difference. With their destructive armor-focused payload, these missiles will make short work of even quite large ships once you've stripped them of their shields. Pairing with Spearhead missiles is recommended for best performance.</description>
