  <description>Any scanner can give the mass, position and velocity of an asteroid. But miners prefer to know the asteroid's value. For that purpose, some miners add a scanner array such as this one, able to deduce the surface composition from spectroscopy and infer the internal composition via inverse electrical impedance.</description>
