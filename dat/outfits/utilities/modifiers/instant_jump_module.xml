  <description>Normally, it takes time for a ship's hyperdrive to synchronize with a Jump Point and initiate a jump, leaving occupants vulnerable for a short period of time. For pilots venturing into dangerous territory who can't afford to stop for even a moment, an Instant Jump Module is a must. This dedicated module works in real-time to pre-prepare the hyperdrive for synchronization with any potential jump point, rendering the process instantaneous.</description>
