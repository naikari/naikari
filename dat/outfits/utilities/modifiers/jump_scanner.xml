  <description>This device installs a secondary scanning array on the ship. The array is programmed with the known characteristics of the spatial anomalies associated with hyperspace jumps. Because the scanner detects a very specific kind of signature, its range can be easily boosted without sacrificing accuracy. In effect, this means that a ship with one or more of these scanners installed can detect jump points at a greater range. The scanner will not detect jump points whose signature differs from the standard type.</description>
