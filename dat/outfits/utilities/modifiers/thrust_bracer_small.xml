  <description>In addition to rerouting some of the ship's power, a thrust bracer provides an extra buffer to the engine's cooling and matter-antimatter circulation system, enabling the engine to more easily propel loads above its weight class. While not as space-efficient or energy-efficient as using a heavier engine, and coming at the cost of poorer steering, it's a good solution for pilots who just need to be able to carry a little bit more without potentially missing a deadline.</description>
